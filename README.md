This is a project in the course Database Technology at LTH, where the task was to design a relational database based on a description of a company's process and needs, write the SQL code to create that database and then create a REST API which accessed the database to implement a given set of endpoints. The API is written in Python and implements endpoints for things like placing orders, adding new recipes and registering deliveries of ingredients, with validation and error handling for missing or invalid data. It uses an SQLite database with tables and triggers, and communicates with it with operations that are transactional and secure against SQL injection. Included in the repository is an ER diagram describing the database and the SQL code to create it. To use the program, first run ```sqlite3 project.sqlite < create-schema.sql``` and then ```python app.py```.
